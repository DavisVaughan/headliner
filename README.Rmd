# headliner

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `headliner` is to help analysts to translate facts to insights. In the comparison below ([source](https://blog.prototypr.io/dashboard-design-5-things-every-ux-designer-should-know-a85c4558d75)), both dashboards have the same underlying data but how they present the information to the user is very different.

</div>

Right now, there isn't anything out of the box to help users dynamically create phrasing like used in the "insights" version without a bit of coding gymnastics. The many ways you could approach it combined with the steps required to say "if positive, show it like this, if negative show it like that" increase the technical debt this kind of code could add to a project. For this reason, `headliner` is designed to deliver the building blocks required to create these phrases for plot titles, value boxes in `shiny` or section headers in a report.

## Installation

You can install the dev version of `headliner` from [github](https://github.com/rjake/headliner) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("rjake/headliner")
```

## Usage

For these examples, I will use a function called `demo_data()` to build a data set based on the current date `r format(Sys.Date(), "%D")`.
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(headliner)
library(glue)

demo_data()
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
library(glue)
demo_data()
```


What we want is to say something like this:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
demo_data() %>%
  add_date_columns(date) %>% 
  compare_conditions(
    compare = month == 0,
    reference = month == -12,
    cols = x
  ) %>% 
  compare_values(
    compare = mean_x_comp, 
    reference = mean_x_ref,
    calc = "prop"
  ) %>% 
  glue_data(
    "We have seen a {delta}% {trend} compared to the same time last year."
  )
```

We can look at the data an see that about 12 months ago, x was 107 where as today it is 101. One function available in headliner is `compare_values()`. This function returns a named list.
```{r}
compare_values(101, 107, calc = "prop") %>% head(2)
```

With this list, you can use `glue_data()` to combine the results.
```{r}
compare_values(101, 107, calc = "prop") %>% 
  glue_data(
    "we had a {delta}% {trend} since last year ({expr})"
  )
```

But let's see if we can make this more dynamic...

First, we can use a function called `add_date_columns()` to calculate distances from the current date (or the refence date specified) to the values in the `date` column . With these new fields we can see that `r format(demo_data()$date[2], "%D")` was 60 days ago (or 9 weeks or 2 months, ...) from the current date.
```{r}
demo_data() %>%
  add_date_columns(date_col = date)
```

We can then identify some conditions for our comparison (`compare`) and our reference group (`reference`). This step uses the kind of logic you would use in `dplyr::filter()` or `base::subset()`
```{r}
demo_data() %>%
  add_date_columns(date) %>% 
  compare_conditions(
    compare = (month == 0),     # this month
    reference = (month == -12), # vs 12 months ago
    cols = c(x),                # the column(s) to aggregate
    calc = list(mean = mean)    # the list of functions passed to summarise(across(...))
  )
```

It might look funny to see `list(mean = mean)`. The name (left side) is how it will name the values, the right side is the function to use. If I had used `calc = list(avg = mean)` The names would have been `avg_x_*`. Because `compare_conditions()` uses the mean as the default, I'll omit it going forward. Now that I have my output as a named list, I can pipe it into `compare_values()`. This step will give me the building blocks to write my phrases. 

```{r}
compare <-
  demo_data() %>%
  add_date_columns(date) %>% 
  compare_conditions(
    compare = (month == 0),
    reference = (month == -12),
    cols = c(x)
  ) %>% 
  compare_values(
    compare = mean_x_comp, 
    reference = mean_x_ref,
    calc = "prop"
  )

compare
```

I can then use `paste()` or `glue::glue_data()` to create my final phrase
```{r}
compare %>% 
  glue_data(
    "We have seen a {delta}% {trend} compared to the same time last year ({expr})"
  )
```

We can also use these pieces in a `valueBox()`
```{r eval=FALSE}
box_color <- ifelse(compare$sign == -1, "red", "blue")

shinydashboard::valueBox(
  value = glue_data(compare, '{delta}% {trend}'),
  subtitle = "vs. the same time last year",
  color = box_color
) 
```

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="man/figures/value_box.png"  width=300/>
</div>



```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(shinydashboard)

shinyApp(
  ui = dashboardPage(
   dashboardHeader(title = "Value boxes"),
    dashboardSidebar(),
    dashboardBody(
      fluidRow(
        valueBox("5.6% decrease", "vs. the same time last year", color = "red")
      )
      )
   ),
  server = function(input, output) {}
)
```


We can also used `compare_conditions()` to compare categorical criteria. Here I am using `trend_terms()` to use "more" and "less" instead of the default "increase" and "decrease" terminology.
```{r}
demo_data() %>%
  compare_conditions(
    compare = group == "a",
    reference = group == "c",
    cols = c(x)
  ) %>% 
  compare_values(
    compare = mean_x_comp, 
    reference = mean_x_ref, 
    trend_phrasing = 
      trend_terms(more = "up",  less = "down")
  ) %>% 
  glue_data(
    "Group A is {trend} {delta} points ({comp_value}) \\
    compared to Group C ({ref_value})"
  )
```
